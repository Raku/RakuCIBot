Build the container with

    podman build -t raku-ci-bot .

run it with

    podman run --rm -p 10000:10000 raku-ci-bot

To export the container for upload to a server do

    podman save localhost/raku-ci-bot:latest | gzip > raku-ci-bot_latest.tgz

For quicker uploads it might make sense to not C<gzip> the image and use
C<rsync> for the upload.

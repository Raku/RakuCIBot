    zef install OpenAPI::Model JSON::Fast Template::Mustache Cro::WebApp PathTools
    git clone https://github.com/patrickbkr/perl6-WebService-GitHub.git
    cd perl6-WebService-GitHub/dev-scripts
    ./generate-code
    # files will end up in perl6-WebService-GitHub/gen

    zef install App::Prove6
    cd /path/to/RakuCIBot
    zef install --deps-only .
    prove6 -I. -I/path/to/perl6-WebService-GitHub/gen
